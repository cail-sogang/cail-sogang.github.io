Our paper is accepted to The 25th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM-25) ðŸŽ‰.

This paper introduces the concept of Populated Region Set (PRS) to analyze internal properties of deep neural networks related to adversarial robustness. Through empirical studies, we show that a low PRS ratio is strongly linked to model robustness and propose a PRS-based regularizer that improves robustness without adversarial training.
